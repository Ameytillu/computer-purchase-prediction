### Computer Purchase Prediction App

I built this project to predict whether a user is likely to buy a computer based on their online behavior and demographics. The model uses Logistic Regression and is deployed using Streamlit for live interaction and visualization.

- Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand user behavior and predict purchase intent. The dataset includes features like:

- Daily Time Spent on Site

- Age

- Area Income

- Daily Internet Usage

- Gender

After data exploration and preprocessing, I trained a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-Learn and created a pipeline to automate all steps — from data transformation to prediction.

- Key Steps in the Project

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Checked patterns and correlations between features and target.

Feature Engineering – Cleaned and prepared data for modeling.

Model Building – Implemented Logistic Regression using a Scikit-Learn pipeline.

Evaluation – Analyzed accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Deployment – Built an interactive Streamlit web app for real-time prediction and visualization.
